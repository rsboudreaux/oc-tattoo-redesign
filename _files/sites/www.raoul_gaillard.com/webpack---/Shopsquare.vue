				Iâ€™ve worked for shopsquare for 6 months as a fullstack developer. Shopsquare was built completely in Laravel, a great PHP framework. This is a good technical choice when you have a classic e-commerce website. Shopsquare has to deal with millions of products that come from multiple data sources and respond in a second. So one of my missions was to combine Laravel to Algolia.

			<div class="case-study__title">What I learned</div>
			<div class="case-study__text-content">
				More than technical knowledge, what I learned at Shosquare is how a Startup work. Further than the classical ping-pong-table, I have integrated a great team of motivated people who get up in the morning with one purpose: enhance their product, take decisions and learn from their mistakes.
