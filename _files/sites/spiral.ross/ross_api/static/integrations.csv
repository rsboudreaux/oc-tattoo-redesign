1446,"<p>Renaissance Iconography</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
","<p>In their study of Renaissance Italy, students become experts on the narratives and iconography of 15 paintings of the period. They create a presentation of their findings to share with their peers. They also explore some of the major commissions of the period, such as the renovation of St. Peter&rsquo;s Basilica. This project also ties into their study of Machiavelli&rsquo;s <em>The Prince</em> in English, during which they play a Renaissance simulation game based on the text. In the game, the paintings studied become &ldquo;cultural items&rdquo; that can be acquired during auction. During Visual Arts, students sketch the body using Renaissance techniques. In Science, they study the work of Leonardo as a scientist and artist. Their work from this project is captured in their Leonardo Sketchbook as a summative assessment for Science and Visual Arts.</p>
