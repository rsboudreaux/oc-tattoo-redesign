}"">Voyages of Exploration</p>
","<p>In this unit, students examine how increased movement of people, ideas, and capital contributed to the expansion, collision, and fusion of cultures. Key concepts include the Ming dynasty seafaring expeditions followed by a turn inward, which allowed Europeans to predominate in world exploration; the Islamic Golden Age and the shift to the religious intolerance of the Reconquista; and explorations of the Americas and the conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires. Students use events of the past to address and understand such current issues as religious intolerance, cultural diffusion, multiple conflicting perspectives, economy, and warfare. As an integrated learning experience, students examine six primary sources from a variety of points of view, documenting a Spanish massacre of the Aztecs that occurred in their main temple of Tenochtitlan. The unit also features a cartography project that begins with an examination of maps as cultural artifacts reflecting philosophical, economic, religious, and political worldviews. Students examine the implications of the movement of flora, fauna, disease, resources, goods, information, religion, and culture between China and Europe and between Europe and the Americas.</p>

}"">Italian Renaissance</p>
","<p>In this unit, students examine a fundamental shift that occurred during the emergence from medievalism on the Italian Peninsula in the 15th and 16th centuries. A more modern economy, fueled by expanding trade and improved technology, created new opportunities for individuals with an expanded worldview. Unshackled from a static feudal structure, an emerging merchant class turned to artists to glorify and legitimize their forward momentum. A recapitulation of humanistic ideas, funneled through a heightened appreciation of classical achievements, manifested in the studios, municipal buildings, streets, and piazzas of the Italian city-states. Architecture became a metaphor for the human figure as divine.</p>

Students focus on the rapid changes brought about by the attacks on the Catholic Church and the development of the printing press. They discuss how access to capital and information, as well as the exchange of ideas, can transform a power structure. They examine theological issues, leading to a study of Elizabethan England and the creation of the Church of England. Students also study the impact of the reign of Elizabeth I and learn what it would have been like to live during that time.

","<p>The purpose of this short unit is to provide students context for understanding the political, cultural, and religious implications of the Scientific Revolution. The unit begins with a review of the turmoil within society, particularly the Church, during this period and the impact the natural philosophers&rsquo; work made upon society. Students also review the history of cosmology from the ancients through the Middle Ages in order to understand the revolutionary nature of the scientific discoveries of the period. They examine the historical impact of these discoveries on the scientific community, common people, literary and visual artists, and the Catholic Church. As a final project, students both debate and write a paper on the person they believe is theâ€¨ first modern scientist, utilizing deductive reasoning, logical fallacies, and basic rhetorical strategies from Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Rhetoric.</em></p>

With the collapse of the medieval world and the movement of people creating a complex economy, colonization of the &ldquo;New World&rdquo; took on new proportions. Emerging mercantilism gave rise to a more secular society, independent of the Church. Moving away from medieval societies dominated by a centrality of faith and hierarchy, the birth of this early modern society heralded dynamic movement and change not only across oceans but also across new social classes.&nbsp;</p>

During this revolution in ways of thinking, the marriage of empirical evidence and mathematical reasoning replaced conformity to the established authority as the preferred approach to understanding the universe.</p>

<p>Students begin their studies with an analysis of the sensory evidence that supports a geocentric model of our Solar System, while also exploring the characteristics of the larger Universe. They use computer simulations to investigate positional astronomy; these simulations help them to understand the underlying tenets of the geocentric model, in preparation for examining evidence for a heliocentric model and the historical context for this revolutionary shift in viewing the Universe and Earth&rsquo;s place in it.

They apply a few different methods, drawing on their conceptual understanding of decimal place value, to find a rational approximation of those irrational numbers. Students explore fundamental components of rational numbers, including multiples, factors, divisibility rules, and prime factors. Throughout the unit, students express numbers using geometric representations. They apply their understanding of rational number concepts to integrated studies in Science and Cultural History, including Olmec archaeoastronomy and Phoenician mariner trade routes and mapping.</p>

","<p>The 17th and 18th centuries provided a stark contrast between the rhetoric of reason and individual rights and the massive injustice of the entrenchment of the institution of chattel slavery. This unit begins by exploring England&rsquo;s constitutional monarchy and the changes introduced by the Glorious Revolution, with its imposition of limits on monarchical power and the triumph of the idea of natural rights. Juxtaposed with this celebration of increasing personal freedom is its opposite: the development of the transatlantic slave trade, in which millions of Africans were seized, shipped across the ocean, and forced to labor for the profit of others. The unit explores the personal, economic, social, and cultural consequences of this movement, including a study of the rich culture of the Yoruba people of West Africa and the way some who protested slavery used Enlightenment rhetoric in their demands for change. Through reading and discussing works by Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Daniel Defoe, Immanuel Kant, and Voltaire, students consider the intellectual underpinnings of this time of change in European society and government, as power shifted from the landed aristocracy to an emerging entrepreneurial middle class.</p>
